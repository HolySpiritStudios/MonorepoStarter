Controllers must:

- Simply compose the service methods into a single unified interface.
- Always have an interface that defines the methods that the controller must implement.
- Always have a mock controller that implements the interface and can be used for testing, which just throws NotFound errors. See backend\app\common\utils\errors.ts for the errors.
