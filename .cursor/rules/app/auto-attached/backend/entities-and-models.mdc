Entities and models must:

- Always use zod schemas and infered types.
- Entities represent TypeScript objects that are posted in the database, whereas models can be used for any other TypeScript objects, including API request and response objects.

Example:

```typescript
export const ltiLaunchResponseSchema = z.object({
  redirectUrl: z.string().url().describe('URL to redirect the user to after successful LTI launch'),
});
export type LtiLaunchResponse = z.infer<typeof ltiLaunchResponseSchema>;
```
