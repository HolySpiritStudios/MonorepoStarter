Naming conventions:
- File and folder names must be in lower middle snake case, for example backend\entrypoints\learning-api-handler.lambda.ts
- File names must include the stereotype of the file at the end, preceded by a dot, for example `learning-api-handler.lambda.ts`. Common stereotypes include: lambda, container, controller, router, service, repository, entity, model, util.
