# Assets Definition

This directory contains the docs on how to organize assets in the project.

## Structure

Assets should be organized in directories based on their file type with the following structure:

```
assets/
  images/
    example-image.png
  icons/
    example-icon.svg
  fonts/
    example-font.ttf
  videos/
    example-video.mp4
  gifs/
    example-gif.gif
  audios/
    example-audio.mp3
```

## Rules

- Use `kebab-case` for the file names.
